# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on the TikTok application using user comments data obtained from the Google Play Store. The methods used in this analysis include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes Multinomial.



**Project Description**
The TikTok application has become a global phenomenon with millions of users worldwide. In this project, we utilize user comments data from the Play Store to understand the general sentiment towards the application. We implement several classification models to analyze the sentiment of these comments and compare the performance of each model.



**Methods**
The methods used in this project are as follows:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a classification model that attempts to separate two classes by maximizing the margin between the classes.
- Decision Tree: Decision Tree is a classification model that uses a tree-like structure to make decisions for classifying data.
- Naive Bayes Multinomial: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of feature independence.


  
**Results**
The results of sentiment analysis using these three methods are as follows:
- SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.75.
- Decision Tree model obtained an accuracy of 0.68.
- Naive Bayes Multinomial model has an accuracy of 0.74.
